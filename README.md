To set up and run this project, you'll need to install several Python packages. Here are the steps and the required pip install commands, including creating and activating a virtual environment:

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```python3 -m venv venv```

Activate the virtual environment:

```venv\Scripts\activate```

Install the packages

```pip install Flask Flask-SocketIO psycopg2-binary python-dotenv```

Flask: A micro web framework for Python.
Flask-SocketIO: Adds WebSocket support to Flask applications.
psycopg2-binary: A PostgreSQL adapter for Python (binary version for ease of installation).
python-dotenv: Reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables.
Ensure you have requests installed (if it's used for any additional functionality):


Install this for making REST calls
```pip install requests```

Create the .env file with your database configuration and secret key. Here's an example:

SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key<br/>
DB_NAME=your_db_name<br/>
DB_USER=your_db_user<br/>
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password<br/>
DB_HOST=your_db_host<br/>
DB_PORT=your_db_port<br/>

With these steps and installations, your Flask project with WebSocket support and PostgreSQL should be set up and ready to run. If you have any additional packages specific to your project, you should include those as well.
